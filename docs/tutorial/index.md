## Tutorial

This tutorial is designed to familiarize KEEP administrators and Notes or Web developers with the KEEP API.

---

**Note** KEEP must be [installed](../installconfig/index) and running.

---

In this tutorial, we will use the database `Demo.nsf`. You can download it from [Resources](../references/downloads).

## What's Next

This tutorial includes multiple sections. You will see how to add a database to the KEEP configuration so that its content can be accessed by the KEEP API. You will also perform basic actions like viewing the list of databases, checking the views and forms, creating a document, deleting a document and more. Each of these actions can performed using the AdminUI or Postman/curl.
