## User Tools

Below is the list of tools that can be used when dealing with REST APIs. Some of these tools are referred to in this documentation. You can, however, use whichever tool you are comfortable with.

| [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)                  | Cross-platform tool to interact with REST resources. Easy to use and very powerful when testing APIs. We provide [sample collections] for it, for you to try. |
| [CharlesProxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/)        | HTTP(S) proxy to debug. Especially helpful when the client is not a browser.                                                                                  |

| [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)   | Allows visualization and interaction with APIs without the need for actual implementation logic.                                                              |
