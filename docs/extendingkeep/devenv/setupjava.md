## Setup Java 8

This section describes how to install the proper version of Java and then configure it to support development builds.

### Install Java 8

Both the **Windows** and **Mac** version of OpenJDK Version 8 can be downloaded from the AdoptOpenJDK foundation here:

https://adoptopenjdk.net/index.html

You want the latest version of Java 8 (not the latest version of Java) so select **OpenJDK 8 (LTS)**. Now click **Latest Release** to begin the download.  Once the download completes, open up your downloads directory and run the installer.

![OpenJDK]({{ '/assets/images/OpenJDK.png' | relative_url }})

### Configure Java 8

The OpenJDK requires a little configuration to function properly as part of a KEEP build.

#### Set JAVA_HOME

Bring up your environment variables, and add JAVA_HOME to point to your new Java 8 directory (for example: C:\Java8\jdk8u252-b09).  This will allow the build to find the proper Java instance.

#### Set symbolic links

For KEEP to build properly, the Java 8 compiler needs to be able to resolve Notes Domino references. This done by configuring symbolic links between the Java 8 lib directory and the Notes lib directory, for three Notes jars.

For **Windows**, open a command window and go to the jre\lib\ext directory within your OpenJDK directory.  

Then create the sybolic links for the **Notes.jar**, the **websvc.jar**, and the **njempcl.jar**.

**cd %JAVA_HOME%\jre\lib\ext**

**mklink .\Notes.jar   C:\Notes\jvm\lib\ext\Notes.jar**

**mklink .\websvc.jar  C:\Notes\jvm\lib\ext\websvc.jar**

**mklink .\njempcl.jar C:\Notes\jvm\lib\ext\njempcl.jar**

Note: If your Notes is not installed in C:\Notes adjust the paths above accordingly.

For the **Mac**, the process is essentially the same, except you would use the Mac symbolic link command: **ln -s**
