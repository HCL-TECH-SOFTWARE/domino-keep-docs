# Post Installation Tasks

This chapter describes tasks you can perform after installing an instance of KEEP.

## [Securing ports](../configuration/configuringPorts)

## [Enable a database](../../usingkeep/enablingadb)

## [Configure JWT](../configuration/security/authentication)

## [Sharing JWT between servers](../configuration/security/encryption)

## [Configure apps](../../tutorial/adminui)

## [Setup functional Accounts](./functionalUsers)

There are a series of endpoints that are not associated with regular user ids:

- Management console (Port 8889)
- Metrics endpoint (Port 8890)
- Health check (Port 8886)

To enable access to those, you need functional accounts
