## Running KEEP with a Docker image

The KEEP Docker image is built on top of an HCL Domino Docker image, inspired by [the open source templates](https://github.com/IBM/domino-docker).
All configuration options found there can be applied to the KEEP Docker image. You will need to decide if you want to run a standalone server or an additional server in an existing Domino domain.

### Prerequisites

Running KEEP with a Docker image requires the following:

- A Docker installation, both **Docker** (for servers) or **Docker Desktop** are suitable. Download and install [Docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your environment (Linux, Windows or macOS).
- **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)**. When you install a Docker Desktop version (Windows, macOS), Docker compose is already included. For servers, it is an [additional install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Login to HCL's instance of [FlexNet](https://hclsoftware.flexnetoperations.com/) using your credentials and download the [KEEP Docker image](https://hclsoftware.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operationsportal/entitledDownloadFile.action?downloadPkgId=HCL_Domino_REST_API_EAP) as an archive file.
- A valid Domino server id, when you want to run as additional server in your existing domain.
- A Docker compose file from our [resources](../../../references/downloads). Select the matching one for either a standalone primary or a secondary server.
- A `.env` file. Download the `sample.env` from our [resources](../../../references/downloads). You **must rename the file to `.env` and edit** the `.env` file and update your values!

### Getting Ready

A Domino server uses one persistent volume to store its data. This volume also stores log files and the serverâ€™s ID file. When you remove the container, that volume remains and is reused when you start a new container instance.

When you want to run multiple servers, create separate volumes for each, DO NOT share volumes between running instances.

- Make sure, your server id file is named `server.id`.
- Rename the compose file you downloaded from [resources](../../../references/downloads) to `docker-compose.yml`.
- Edit the `.env` file to update your values. You need to replace all values after the equal (`=`) sign

You can configure multiple Domino servers in a single compose file. For details, check the [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) documentation. Keep in mind, each server needs its own volume.

Load the docker image that you've downloaded from [prerequisites](#prerequisites) above:

```bash
docker load -i [name_of_tar_file].tar
```

### Table of variables

Depending on the compose file you choose, a different set of variables needs to be replaced. If a variable isn't in the compose file, you don't need it.

| Variable         | Example                | Remarks                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| hostname         | domino.acme.com        | Pro tip: use something.local dor local testing |
| admin_name       | Peter Parker           |
| container_name   | domino-keep-test02     |
| domain_name      | MarvelPhase4           | YOUR EXSISTING NOTES DOMAIN                    |
| org_name         | Stark Industries       | YOUR EXSISTING ORG                             |
| server_name      | keep-server-01         |
| network_hostname | keep01.domino.acme.com | MUST RESOLVE                                   |
| admin_server     | domino01               | YOUR EXISTING SERVER                           |
| admin_ip         | 10.45.10.3             | MUST BE REACHABLE, can use DNS too             |
| volume_name      | domino_keep_notesdata  | no spaces or special chars                     |
| admin_firstname  | Paul                   |
| admin_lastname   | Herbert                |
| admin_password   | domin4ever             |
| cert_password    | supersecret            |

## Running KEEP

Start KEEP using `docker-compose` on all supported platforms:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

---

> Note Start in the directory where the files `server.id` and `docker-compose.yml` are located!

---

The setup can take a few minutes, depending on your hardware and the network speed to your primary server.

---

> Pro Tip: when you don't have DNS setup, amend your hosts file for name resolution:
>
> - `/etc/hosts` on Linux or macOS
> - `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows

---

Note:

- You can then use Docker desktop to start/stop the container.
- Use `docker-compose up -d` to run docker in the background.
- Do not run two KEEP containers sharing the same volume at the same time, alternate (e.g. debug/non-debug) or with 2 different volumes is OK.

## Validation

To validate that an instance is successfully running on a container:

- A docker container should be created and running on your docker machine. To check that the container is up, issue this command on a terminal:

```bash
docker ps
```

- The container should be accessible via

```bash
docker exec -it $containername /bin/bash
```

- Domino should be accessible on `http://$host:80` (might need configuration).
- KEEP should be accessible on `http://$host:8880`.
- KEEP Management should be accessible on `http://$host:8889`.
- Metrics should be accessible on `http://$host:8890/metrics`.
