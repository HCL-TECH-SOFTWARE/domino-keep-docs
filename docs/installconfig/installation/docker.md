## Running KEEP with a Docker image

The KEEP Docker image is built on top of an HCL Domino Docker image, inspired by [the open source templates](https://github.com/IBM/domino-docker).
All configuration options found there can be applied to the KEEP Docker image. You will need to decide if you want to run a standalone server or an additional server in an existing Domino domain.

### Prerequisites

Running KEEP with a Docker image requires the following:

- A Docker installation, both **Docker** (for servers) or **Docker Desktop** are suitable. Download and install [Docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your environment (Linux, Windows or macOS).
- **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)**. When you install a Docker Desktop version (Windows, macOS), Docker compose is already included. For servers, it is an [additional install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Login to HCL's instance of [FlexNet](https://hclsoftware.flexnetoperations.com/) using your credentials and download the [KEEP Docker image](https://hclsoftware.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operationsportal/entitledDownloadFile.action?downloadPkgId=HCL_Domino_REST_API_EAP) as an archive file.
- A valid Domino server id, when you want to run as additional server in your existing domain.
- A Docker compose file from our [resources](../../../references/downloads). Select the matching one for either a standalone primary or a secondary server.
- A `.env` file. Download the `sample.env` from our [resources](../../../references/downloads). You **must rename the file to `.env` and edit** the `.env` file and update your values!

### Getting Ready

A Domino server uses one persistent volume to store its data. This volume also stores log files and the serverâ€™s ID file. When you remove the container, that volume remains and is reused when you start a new container instance.

![Docker Consumption](../../assets/images/DominoKeepContainers.png)

When you want to run multiple servers, create separate volumes for each, DO NOT share volumes between running instances.

- Make sure, your server id file is named `server.id`.
- Rename the compose file you downloaded from [resources](../../../references/downloads) to `docker-compose.yml`.
- Edit the `.env` file to update your values. You need to replace all values after the equal (`=`) sign

You can configure multiple Domino servers in a single compose file. For details, check the [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) documentation. Keep in mind, each server needs its own volume.

Load the docker image that you've downloaded from [prerequisites](#prerequisites) above:

```bash
docker load -i [name_of_tar_file].tar
```

### Table of variables

Depending on the compose file you choose, a different set of variables needs to be replaced. If a variable isn't in the compose file, you don't need it. We keep the variable names in sync with [One-touch Domino setup](https://help.hcltechsw.com/domino/12.0.0/admin/wn_one-touch_domino_setup.html), thus in the compose file you will find gems like `SERVERSETUP_SERVER_NAME: "${SERVERSETUP_SERVER_NAME}"`. This makes naming of variables consisten.

Please also refer to the official [List of One-touch environment variables](https://help.hcltechsw.com/domino/12.0.0/admin/inst_onetouch_preparing_sysenv.html) for reference.

## Running KEEP

Start KEEP using `docker-compose` on all supported platforms:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

---

> **Note:** Start in the directory where the files `server.id` and `docker-compose.yml` are located!

---

The setup can take a few minutes, depending on your hardware and the network speed to your primary server.

---

> Pro Tip: when you don't have DNS setup, amend your hosts file for name resolution:
>
> - `/etc/hosts` on Linux or macOS
> - `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows

---

Note:

- You can then use Docker desktop to start/stop the container.
- Use `docker-compose up -d` to run docker in the background.
- Do not run two KEEP containers sharing the same volume at the same time, alternate (e.g. debug/non-debug) or with 2 different volumes is OK.

## Validation

To validate that an instance is successfully running on a container:

- A docker container should be created and running on your docker machine. To check that the container is up, issue this command on a terminal:

```bash
docker ps
```

- The container should be accessible via

```bash
docker exec -it $containername /bin/bash
```

- Domino should be accessible on `http://$host:80` (might need configuration).
- KEEP should be accessible on `http://$host:8880`.
- KEEP Management should be accessible on `http://$host:8889`.
- Metrics should be accessible on `http://$host:8890/metrics`.

## Alternate Docker cofiguration

When you run you Domino servers on Linux, you probably use the [Nashcom startup script](https://www.nashcom.de/nshweb/pages/startscript.htm) for Domino.
On this foundation the GitHub.com hosted [Domino Docker](https://github.com/IBM/domino-docker) project offers management scripts that allows easy management of
your Docker container using a command `domino_container`.

Installation steps are as follows:

1. Clone the [domino-docker](https://github.com/IBM/domino-docker) repository: `git clone https://github.com/IBM/domino-docker.git`
2. Change into the installations directory: `cd start_script`
3. Run the installer `./install_domino_container` (You might need `sudo`)

Now you have the command `domino_container` at your disposal:

- use `domino_container cfg`, to set your configuration
- use `domino_container env` for the environment values
- start Doinin and KEEP using `domino_container start`
- Learn more about the scripts using `domino_container help`
