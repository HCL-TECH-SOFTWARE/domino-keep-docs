## Custom Identity Provider (IdP)

KEEP requires an access token in [JWT](https://jwt.io/) ([RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)) format. As long as KEEP trusts the signature of the presented token, it does not matter how the token was obtained.

---

**Note**: Check carefully which systems you trust to provide identity. They hold the key to data access.

---

When none of the existing IdP solutions fit your needs, you can use a custom provider that generates your JWT token. Just make sure, such code isn't accessible for abuse as unauthorized impersonation.

## Sample function

This function turns a given user name and scope into a signed JWT token.

```js
const template = require("./template.json");
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const fs = require("fs");
const privateKey = fs.readFileSync("private.key");

const signOptions = {
  algorithm: "RS256",
  expiresIn: `${template.expSeconds}s`,
  mutatePayload: true,
};

const renderJwt = (sub, scope) => {
  const claim = { sub, scope, ...template };
  const bearer = jwt.sign(claim, privateKey, signOptions);
  return { bearer: bearer, ...claim };
};

module.export = { renderJwt };
```

Error handling omitted for clarity.

## The template

```json
{
  "iss": "Joe and the wailors",
  "aud": "Domino",
  "expSeconds": 3000
}
```

## Dependencies

This the relevant part of the `package.json`

```json
"dependencies": {
    "jsonwebtoken": "^8.5.1"
  }
```

## Keys you need

You need to generate a public/private key pair.

```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f private.key
openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -outform PEM -out public.key.pub
```
